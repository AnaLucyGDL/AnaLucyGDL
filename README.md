### Lucy Guzm√°n üñç

Hi there~. My name is Ana Lucia, but everyone calls me Lucy. And I like it.

I am a student of an engineering career in software development, and the programming languages that I'm learning, and hope to dominate, are CSS, C#, JavaScript, C++, and others. Of course, I'm open to learn about more languajes/technologies.

‚Ä¢ I have the goal of working in a company as a programmer, tester or designer. It's always better to have more than just one option.

‚Ä¢ I'm currently searching for projects to learn with.
